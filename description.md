Adds gold, silver, platinum and palladium to the game. Reworks processing units and much more.

This mod adds more complexity to a vanailla factorio game, especially after chemical science, though silver shows up earlier. As always, the more BZ mods you add the more complex the game will become. 

Note, when silver from this mod is used with [Lead](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/bzlead), lead outputs a silver byproduct instead of a copper byproduct.

Supported compatible mods:

- Space Exploration & AAI
- Krastorio 2
- Bob's electronics, 248k, Mod Mash Splinter Gold
- Deadlock stacking, crating

Coming soon: RSO
Coming soon: FE+, 5Dim's, ScienceCostTweaker, etc.

Many other mods are compatible but not yet fully supported. Suggestions always appreciated!
